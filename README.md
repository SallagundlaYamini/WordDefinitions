# WordDefinitions
Word definitions: Users can input a word and the API can provide the definition.
This project implements a functionality where users can input a word, and the API will provide the definition of that word using the ChatGPT API.
This application allows users to enter a word for which they want to know the definition. The application then makes use of the ChatGPT API to generate the definition of the word based on the trained language model. The definition is retrieved from the API response and displayed to the user.

## Features

- Input field: Users can enter a word in an input field.
- Definition generation: The application sends the user's input to the ChatGPT API and generates a definition. 
- Definition display: The generated definition is presented to the user in a clear and readable format.
